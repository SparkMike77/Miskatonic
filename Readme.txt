This is me goffing around with building my own private version of Google Glass

Using:
3D Printed enclosure
ESP32 CAM module
1 micro SD card (probably)
Arduino Nano (probably)
a small LCD screen
a Bluetooth Hands free earbud thing (probably)
some form of small Lipo
An Android Phone App
Salvaged plastic as a reflector

Posted the v3 of the enclosure, using the ESP32 CAM Arduino basic test sketch so far, works well enough.
